## <span style="color: #0081a7">Creative, Compassionate, Collaborative</span>


I am a Full Stack Software Developer with experience in Javascript, React, Node and relational databases. I seek to bring joy and ease to people's lives through human-centered design and clean, concise coding. Coming from a rich background of customer-focused roles in knitting, literature and veterinary medicine has taught me to approach problem from creative angles with an open curiosity. 

I believe that accessible, inclusive tech is a powerful tool and a crucial goal. My values-driven work and empathetic communication enable me to thrive on teams both large and small. I love collaborating with dedicated, diverse teams.
