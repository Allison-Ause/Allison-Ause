I am a Full Stack Software Developer with experience in Javascript, React, Node and relational databases. I seek to bring joy and ease to people's lives through human-centered design and clean, concise coding. Coming from a rich background of customer-focused roles in knitting, literature and veterinary medicine has taught me to approach problem from creative angles with open curiosity.
